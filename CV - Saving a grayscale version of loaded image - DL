Saving images is useful if we perform some data preparation on the image before modeling.
One example is converting color images (RGB channels) to grayscale (1 channel). There are a
number of ways to convert an image to grayscale, but Pillow provides the convert() function
and the mode ‘L’ will convert an image to grayscale.

#Saving a grayscale version of loaded image
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#load image
image = Image.open('opera_house.jpg')

#convert image to grayscale
gs_image = image.convert(mode='L')

#save in jpeg format
gs_image.save('opera_house_grayscale.jpg')

#load image again and show it
image2 = Image.open('opera_house_grayscale.jpg')

#show image
plt.imshow(image2)
plt.show()

Running the example loads the photograph, converts it to grayscale, saves the image in a
new file, then loads it again and shows it to confirm that the photo is now grayscale instead of
color.
