An image object can be saved by calling the save() function. This can be useful if you want
to save an image in a different format, in which case the format argument can be specified,
such as PNG, GIF, or PEG. For example, the code listing below loads the photograph in JPEG
format and saves it in PNG format.

#Saving an image into another format
from PIL import Image

#load image
image = Image.open('opera_house.jpg')

#save as PNG format
image.save('opera_house.png', format='PNG')

#load image again and inspect format
image2 = Image.open('opera_house.png')
print(image2.format)

Results:
PNG

Running the example loads the JPEG image, saves it in PNG format, then loads the newly
saved image again, and confirms that the format is indeed PNG.
