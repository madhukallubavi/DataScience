A rotation augmentation randomly rotates the image clockwise by a given number of degrees
from 0 to 360. The rotation will likely rotate pixels out of the image frame and leave areas of
the frame with no pixel data that must be filled in. The example below demonstrates random
rotations via the rotation range argument, with rotations to the image between 0 and 90
degrees.

#Random rotation image augmentation
from numpy import expand_dims
from keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array, ImageDataGenerator
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

#load the image
img = load_img('bird.jpg')

#convert to numpy array
data = img_to_array(img)

#expand dimension to one sample
samples = expand_dims(data, 0)

#create image data augmentation generator
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=90)

#prepare iterator
it = datagen.flow(samples, batch_size=1)

#generate samples and plot
for i in range(9):
  # define subplot
  plt.subplot(330 + 1 + i)
  #generate batch of images
  batch = it.next()
  #convert to unsigned integers for viewing
  image = batch[0].astype('uint32')
  #plot raw pixel data
  plt.imshow(image)
#show the figure
plt.show()

Running the example generates examples of the rotated image, showing in some cases pixels
rotated out of the frame and the nearest-neighbor fill.
