Keras provides access to the IMDB dataset built-in3. The imdb.load data() function allows
us to load the dataset in a format that is ready for use in neural network and deep learning
models. The words have been replaced by integers that indicate the absolute popularity of the
word in the dataset. The sentences in each review are therefore comprised of a sequence of
integers. Calling imdb.load data() the first time will download the IMDB dataset to your computer
and store it in our home directory under /keras/datasets/imdb.pkl as a 32 megabyte file.
Usefully, the imdb.load data() function provides additional arguments including the number
of top words to load (where words with a lower integer are marked as zero in the returned data),
the number of top words to skip (to avoid the the's) and the maximum length of reviews to
support. Let's load the dataset and calculate some properties of it. We will start of by loading
some libraries and loading the entire IMDB dataset as a training dataset.

#load and plot the imdb dataset
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import imdb
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

#load data
(X_train, Y_train), (X_test, Y_test) = imdb.load_data()
X = np.concatenate((X_train, X_test), axis=0)
Y = np.concatenate((Y_train, Y_test), axis=0)

#summarize size
print('Training data: ')
print(X.shape)
print(Y.shape)

#summarize number of classes
print("Classes: ")
print(np.unique(Y))

#summarize number of words
print("Number of workds: ")
print(len(np.unique(np.hstack(X))))

#summarize review length
print('Review length: ')
result = [len(x) for x in X] #(use any code for result)
or
result = list(map(len, X)) #(use any code for result)
print("Mean %.2f words (%f)" % (np.mean(result), np.std(result)))

#plot review length as a boxplot and histogram
plt.subplot(121)
plt.boxplot(result)
plt.subplot(122)
plt.hist(result)
plt.show()

Results:
Training data: 
(50000,)
(50000,)
Classes: 
[0 1]
Number of workds: 
88585
Review length: 
Mean 234.76 words (172.911495)

Looking at the box and whisker plot and the histogram for the review lengths in words,
we can probably see an exponential distribution that we can probably cover the mass of the
distribution with a clipped length of 400 to 500 words.
